O Level Physics Notes

These notes are for the 'O'-Level Physics syllabus [6091]. They might be similar in content to other physics courses too, though structured differently.

These notes are written by myself, which means they are prone to typos and errors. If you find errata, do contact me so I can remedy. or give you access to the Github repository for you to push any changes.

The `tcolorboxes` are copied from [4yn's a-lv-notes repository](https://github.com/4yn/a-lv-notes).

Do whatever you want with these notes. Reproduce them, distribute them, use material from them, go crazy. I don't mind. Unless you republish it without any changes under your own name, we won't have a problem.

Use these notes with caution.
