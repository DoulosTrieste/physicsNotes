		\subsection*{What is Physics?}
			Measurement is a tool that we use in physics a lot. However, it is difficult to get fully accurate measurements due to how well we can create instruments. However we can try to minimise these errors by practising proper measurement techniques. We use measurements to determine physical quantities, and these quantities are communicated with units.
