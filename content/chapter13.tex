	\section{Light}
	\begin{preamb}
		Light can be studied as a wave. In this chapter we will look at how light interacts with matter.

	\pdef{Normal}{The normal is an imaginary line draw perpendicular to the surface that reflection is taking place at.}
	
	\pdef{Angle of Incidence}{The angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and the normal.}
	
	\pdef{Angle of Reflection}{The angle of reflection is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal.}

	\subsection{Reflection}
	\pdef{Law of Reflection}{In reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal are coplanar. \[\theta_1 = \theta_2\]}
	I have chosen to name the angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) due to the reversible nature of light. It does not matter which way the light goes; the angles will be preserved.
