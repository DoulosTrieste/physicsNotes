		These preambles are feeling more dreadful to write because pressure is building up.

	\subsection{Pressure}
		\pdef{Pressure}{Pressure is defined as the amount of force per unit area. It is given as \[p = \frac{F}{A}\] The SI unit of pressure is the pascal [\si{\pascal}].}
		\peqn{Pressure due to a Fluid Column}{Fluids of a density \(\rho\) can exert pressure \(p\) at a height \(h\) equal to}{p = \rho g h}
		\peqn{Transfer of Pressure}{Pressure is constant in an incompressible liquid,}{\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}}
		\peqn{Work Done}{Energy is conserved by the first law of thermodynamics (which is useful to keep in mind when solving hydraulic press problems):}{F_1 d_1 = F_2 d_2}
