	\section{Sound}
	\begin{preamb}
		Sound is transferred in a form of a wave. In this chapter we will explore the different properties of sound and some of its applications.
	\end{preamb}	
	\subsection{Fundamentals}
	Some fundamental properties of sound:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sound is produced by a vibrating source.
		\item Sound exists in the form of a longitudinal wave.
		\item In different media, sound has different speeds. Generally, the higher the density, the faster the speed of sound.
	\end{itemize}

	\peqn{Speed of Sound}{For a sound source from \(d\) away from an observer and capturing it after a time \(t\), the speed of sound can be calculated as}{v = \frac{s}{t}}
