	\section{Transfer of Thermal Energy}
	\begin{preamb}
		Heat can be transferred in multiple ways. In this chapter we will look at three different methods for heat transfer.
	\end{preamb}	
	
	Heat travels from a region of higher temperature to lower temperature.
	
	\pdef{Conduction}{Conduction is the process whereby particles within an object collide with neighbouring particles and thus increasing internal kinetic energy, and thus increasing temperature.}
	
	Metals can conduct heat better due to \textbf{electron diffusion}.
	
	\pdef{Convection}{Convection is the transfer of heat within a fluid due to differences in density.}
	\pdef{Radiation}{Radiation is the process where a body exchanges energy as heat through electromagnetic waves.}
	Factors that affect the rate of radiation include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Colour:} darker objects radiate heat better than lighter objects (see emissivity)
		\item \textbf{Surface:} rougher surfaces radiate heat better than smoother surfaces (due to higher surface area)
	\end{itemize}
	Further reading: Radiation is modelled by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
		\[ P = A \varepsilon \sigma T^4 \]
